Project Name : Quibbler 
Scope and Need:
Quibbler is an app that allows its users to browse news articles from different sources while not having to refer to multiple news apps. It is all the news you need in one place. News is divided into sections and it allows the user to share or save any news article of their liking. To monitor usage we have implemented google sign up using firebase, which gives us real time data about the number of users currently using the application, the user retention rate, user geographic diversity etc.

Work Distribution:
Goutam Rajeev Kumar: Firebase, Google Sign In, News api and settings (date)
Neeharika Ramu : Share Function, Recycler view, Card view and settings (color)
Jovin John Mathew: Fragments, Card View, recycler view and settings (Number of times)
And goutam also did the very important task of annoying everyone
